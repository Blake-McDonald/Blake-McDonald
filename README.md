I'm dedicated to cybersecurity and tackling complex challenges through hands-on projects. My work in areas such as vulnerability management and threat detection allows me to explore the evolving landscape of security in depth. I invite you to review my projects and see how I've contributed to enhancing security operations and processes.

## 🌐 IT Ops Projects: Context

In the following sections, I will present a selection of IT Operations–focused projects, categorized into guided and independent work. The objective is to demonstrate the progression of my skills, highlighting how the foundational knowledge gained through structured tutorials enabled the development of more comprehensive and self-directed projects within sandbox environments.

## 💻 Guided IT Ops Projects

- **[Creating a Windows Answer File for Automated Installation and Deployment on Windows Server 2022]()**




## 👨🏻‍💻 Independant IT Ops Projects



## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Projects: Context

Following the same structure as the IT Operations section, this area will showcase guided projects that progressively lead into independent work, illustrating my competency and understanding across various domains within the cybersecurity landscape. These projects involve tools such as Microsoft Sentinel, Tenable, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and Microsoft Azure (Entra ID). Over time, this section will expand to include more team-specific organization, with a focus on Cybersecurity Operations projects from the Red, Blue, and Purple team perspectives.
